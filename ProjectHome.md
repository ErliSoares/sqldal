Strongly typed data access layer for .NET.

Key features/overview:
Conversion of enumerations of classes to data table parameter types.

Related set reads. You just pass in the relationships.

Runtime types. Types will be created at runtime which represent the returned data rows. These types are relatable.

Serialization to XML or JSON.  Related sets and runtime types can be serialized.  Databound JSON web services can be created very quickly with these features.

ICustomPopulate for defining your own population routine for a class.

Extensible. Define your own providers to access different data sources via the DAL.

There is a user guide DAL.docx included in the source which goes much more in depth and includes usage examples.
